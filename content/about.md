# About Me

Exploring consciousness, cognition, and design.

I am a creative technologist passionate about building digital experiences that bridge the gap between human thought and machine logic. My work explores the intersection of:

- **Cognitive Science**: Understanding how we think and perceive.
- **Design**: Creating intuitive and beautiful interfaces.
- **Technology**: Building robust and scalable systems.
