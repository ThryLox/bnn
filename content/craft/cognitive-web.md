# The Concept

This portfolio is an experiment in **spatial navigation**. Instead of a flat list of links, the user navigates a 3D representation of a "brain" or "network".

## Tech Stack

*   **Next.js 14**: App Router for routing and server components.
*   **React Three Fiber**: Declarative 3D scene management.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid styling and design system.
*   **Framer Motion**: Smooth page transitions and scroll effects.

## Challenges

One of the main challenges was optimizing the **particle system** (Starfield) to run smoothly on mobile devices while maintaining the "cinematic" bloom effect.
